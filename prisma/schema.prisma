// In this updated model:

// - Each `Student` can have multiple `Enrollment` entities, represented by the `enrollments` field in the `Student` model.
// - Each `Class` can have multiple `Enrollment` entities, represented by the `enrollments` field in the `Class` model.
// - Each `AcademicYear` can have multiple `Enrollment` entities, represented by the `enrollments` field in the `AcademicYear` model.
// - Each `Enrollment` is associated with one `Student`, one `Class`, and one `AcademicYear`.

// This setup ensures that each student can be associated with only one class per academic year, and can change classes in the next academic year.
